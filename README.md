# DIGITAL-RADIO-TOOLKIT
A  Python-based Software-Defined Radio (SDR) signal analyzer designed for simulating, visualizing, and analyzing radio signals without requiring physical hardware. It enables users to inspect .wav audio signals, compute Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), generate spectrograms, and detect dominant frequenciesâ€”all in a clean and extensible codebase.
